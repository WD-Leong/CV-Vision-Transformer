# Vision Transformer for Object Detection

This repository contains the code to extend the [Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) for object detection. Unlike the [DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872), this work directly extends the Vision Transformer for the Object Detection scenario, thereby reducing the total number of parameters by removing the decoder. It is still Work In Progress.
